# WSL Payload Builder
## Overview
A shell script for creating minimal WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distributions with embedded payloads. This tool automates the process of building Alpine Linux-based WSL distributions that can execute custom payloads upon launch.

The `Build_WSL_Payload.sh` script downloads the latest Alpine Linux rootfs, customizes it for WSL use, embeds a user-specified executable, and packages everything into a distributable `.wsl` file. 

The `payload.bat` will download the WSL config file from the provided URL and launch it **(will install wsl if not present and admin rights are available)**

This is particularly useful for penetration testing, security research, and custom WSL environment creation.

## Usage

### Building Payloads (Linux/macOS/Windows(WSL))
#### Arguments

- **`-N, --name`**: Specify the default distribution name for WSL
- **`-P, --payload`**: Specify the path to the payload executable file
- **`-H, --help`**: Display the help menu

#### Examples

```bash
# Build a WSL distribution named "CalcWSL" with a custom payload
./Build_WSL_Payload.sh -N CalcWSL -P ./Calc.exe
```
### Running Payloads (Windows)

#### Basic Usage

Option 1.
**Double-Click** - Double clicking the WSL file will execute the payload but will also open a cmd prompt that must be closed manually. (Not recommended)

Option 2.
**Use the payload.bat file**

```cmd
C:\Users\USER_NAME> .\payload.bat
```

#### What it does

The `payload.bat` script automatically:

1. **Downloads** the WSL payload file from a configured URL
2. **Checks** if WSL is already installed on the system
3. **Installs** WSL if not present (requires administrator privileges)
4. **Installs** the downloaded WSL distribution
5. **Cleans up** by removing the distribution and itself after execution.

#### Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** with WSL support
- **Administrator privileges** (if WSL is not already installed)
- **Internet connection** to download the payload file if using the .bat script

#### Configuration

Edit the variables at the top of `payload.bat` to customize:

```batch
set "DOWNLOAD_URL=https://your-server.com/payload.wsl"
set "WSL_FILE=payload.log" # Still testing but can use most file extensions here. 
```

## Security Considerations

- **Payload Execution**: The embedded payload runs with root privileges when the WSL distribution is launched
- **File Permissions**: All executable files are properly set with appropriate permissions
- **Isolation**: The generated WSL distribution is isolated from the host system
