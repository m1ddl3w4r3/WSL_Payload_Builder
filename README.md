# WSL Payload Builder

A powerful shell script for creating custom WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distributions with embedded payloads. This tool automates the process of building Alpine Linux-based WSL distributions that can execute custom payloads upon launch.

## Overview

The `Build_WSL_Payload.sh` script downloads the latest Alpine Linux rootfs, customizes it for WSL use, embeds a user-specified payload executable, and packages everything into a distributable `.wsl` file. This is particularly useful for penetration testing, security research, and custom WSL environment creation.

## Features

- **Automatic Alpine Linux Detection**: Finds and downloads the latest available Alpine Linux version
- **Custom Distribution Naming**: Specify custom names for your WSL distribution
- **Payload Integration**: Embed any executable payload that runs on Alpine Linux
- **WSL Configuration**: Automatically configures WSL-specific settings
- **Root Shell Customization**: Modifies the root user's shell to execute your payload
- **Clean Packaging**: Creates a single `.wsl` file ready for distribution

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
./Build_WSL_Payload.sh [-N|--name] <distribution_name> [-P|--payload] <payload_file>
```

### Required Arguments

- **`-N, --name`**: Specify the default distribution name for WSL
- **`-P, --payload`**: Specify the path to the payload executable file

### Optional Arguments

- **`-H, --help`**: Display the help menu

### Examples

```bash
# Build a WSL distribution named "TestWSL" with a custom payload
./Build_WSL_Payload.sh -N TestWSL -P /path/to/my_payload.exe

# Using long-form arguments
./Build_WSL_Payload.sh --name CalcWSL --payload /path/to/calculator.exe

# Show help menu
./Build_WSL_Payload.sh --help
```

## Security Considerations

- **Payload Execution**: The embedded payload runs with root privileges when the WSL distribution is launched
- **File Permissions**: All executable files are properly set with appropriate permissions
- **Isolation**: The generated WSL distribution is isolated from the host system
- **Validation**: The script validates that the specified payload file exists before proceeding
